# Week7_Rust_ds581

## Valid Parentheses checker
This is a Rust program that checks whether a string has an equal number of open and closed parentheses, while also ensuring that there are no closed parentheses whose corresponding open bracket is after it in the string.

## Usage
To use the program, run `cargo run` in the project directory. The program will ask you for a string of open and close parentheses ( `(` or `)` ). Depending on the input provided, it will tell the user if its a valid string or not
